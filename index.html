                <h3>Brand Identity and Graphic Design</h3>
                <p>I developed a brand identity from scratch by brainstorming and researching ideas for an imaginary brand that would be unique and engaging for a specific target audience. After choosing a concept that I was excited about, I created a logo, color scheme, and typography that aligned with the brand's personality and values.
                    I then applied the brand identity to a range of marketing materials, including business cards, stationery, and social media graphics. This involved experimenting with different layouts, imagery, and messaging to create a cohesive and visually striking brand presence.

                <h3>Computer Science Ants Game</h3>
                <p>I created a a tower defense game called Ants Vs. SomeBees. As the ant queen, you populate your colony with the bravest ants you can muster. Your ants must protect their queen from the evil bees that invade your territory. Irritate the bees enough by throwing leaves at them, and they will be vanquished. Fail to pester the airborne intruders adequately, and your queen will succumb to the bees' wrath. This game is inspired by PopCap Games' Plants Vs. Zombies.
                    This project uses an object-oriented programming paradigm and involves understanding, extending, and testing a large program.

                <h3>Computer Science Maps Project</h3>
                <p>I created a Voronoi visulaization of restaurant scores using machine learning and the Yelp academic dataset.
                    In this visualization, Berkeley is segmented into regions, where each region is shaded by the predicted score of the closest restaurant (yellow is 5 stars, blue is 1 star).
